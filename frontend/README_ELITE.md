## 🎮 Features You'll Experience

### Voice Reactivity
Speak into your microphone and watch the code rain animation respond to your voice intensity in real-time. The faster/louder you speak, the faster the code rain moves!

### Interview Modes
- **Practice Mode**: Calm environment, slow animations (ideal for learning)
- **Pressure Mode**: Realistic interview feel, moderate intensity
- **Extreme Mode**: High-stress training with intense animations

The same questions feel completely different in each mode!

### Speedometer Gauge
Watch a car-inspired gauge that shows your interview readiness:
- 🔴 Red Zone (0-33%): Not ready yet
- 🟡 Yellow Zone (33-66%): Getting there
- 🟢 Green Zone (66-100%): Ready for real interviews!

### Real-Time Metrics
During interviews, see live analysis of:
- **Confidence**: How confident you sound (0-100%)
- **Clarity**: How clear your explanation is (0-100%)
- **Structure**: How organized your answer is (0-100%)

### AI Analysis
Each answer is analyzed for:
- STAR method usage (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
- Answer length appropriateness
- Speaking pace and hesitation
- Overall answer quality

### Data Persistence
Every interview automatically saves. Close the browser and come back later - your data is still there! Statistics are automatically calculated across all your interviews.
